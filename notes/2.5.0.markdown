[Kiama](https://github.com/inkytonik/kiama) is a Scala library for language processing including attribute grammars, term rewriting, abstract state machines, parsing, and pretty printing.

This is a minor release to FIXME, dropping support for Scala 2.10.

### Removals

* Kiama is now supported for Scala versions 2.11 and later, since some of our dependencies are no longer published for 2.10.

### Enhancements

* Irrefutable extractor patterns now return `Some` instead of `Option`. Most notably, `Relation.unapplySeq` now returns `Some[Vector[U]]` instead of `Option[Vector[U]]`. Similarly for `Relation.pair.unapplySeq`.

* Add build support for Scala 3.

### Other

* Move to scalatest 3.2.3, scalacheck 1.15.2. Includes only depending on the ScalaTest modules that we use.

* Move to Scala 2.12.13, sbt 1.5.2, Guava 30.1, Scallop 4.0.1.
