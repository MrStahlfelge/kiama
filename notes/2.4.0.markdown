[Kiama](https://github.com/inkytonik/kiama) is a Scala library for language processing including attribute grammars, term rewriting, abstract state machines and pretty printing.

This is a minor release to eliminate some unused code and a dependency.

### Enhancements

* `Config`: Remove an unused runtime type tag that was needed by an earlier version of the Scallop library. This also removes our dependency on the `scala-reflect` library. (Contributed by @b-studios.)

### Other

* Move to sbt 1.3.13.
