[Kiama](https://bitbucket.org/inkytonik/kiama) is a Scala library for language processing including attribute grammars, term rewriting, abstract state machines and pretty printing.

This is a maintenance release with some minor enhancements and updates.

### Enhancements

* `Tree`: The `CheckTree` version of `Tree` construction now includes more information in the exception reason if the structure is not a tree. Instead of just including the immediate parents of the offending node(s), now all ancestors are included. Also, the index of each node in its parent is shown.
